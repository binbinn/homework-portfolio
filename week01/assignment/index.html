                Hi there, welcome! <br>
                If you want to know me, This is a little bit about myself :)<br>
                I was always that student who was sitting at the back of the classroom didn't care about the class, doing her own thing.<br>
                I was quiet, shy, not so smart, ugly little girl who doesn't meet the socity's standards.<br>
                But I was really creative, positive, polite, philosophical, and happy in my own way.<br>
                Growing up different in Korea was extremely difficult.<br>
                Thanks to my parents, me and my brother were both able to keep our uniqe color.<br>
                Focusing on who I am, what could make me happy, and what's really important in our lives made me who I am right now.<br>
                After graduating High-school, took a year break working part-time, saving money, travling with my mom, studying for college in US.<br>
                I was scared to make a huge change in my life but in the back of my mind, I knew I could do it.<br>
                And<strong> I did it.</strong> <br>
                I'm in the second chaos right now which is so challanging for me, but I will get through this and I will be stronger.<br>
                Thanks to you who visited my page and read all this.<br>
                Peace out!
